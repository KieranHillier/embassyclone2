          STEPS TAKEN BY EMBASSY INGREDIENTS IN 2025
        </h3>
        <p className="legal-paragraph">
          To prevent and reduce the risk that forced labour or child labour is
          used at any step of the production of goods in Canada or elsewhere, or
          of goods imported into Canada, Embassy Ingredients maintained policies
          that include, but are not limited to, a Policy Manual and prioritized
          working with temporary worker agencies that have strong labour
          policies in place.
        </p>

        <h3 className="legal-subheading color-primary">
          POLICIES AND DUE DILLIGENCE PROCESSES
        </h3>
        <p className="legal-paragraph">
          To help prevent and reduce the potential risk that forced labour or
          child labour is used at any step of the production of goods in Canada
          or elsewhere, or of goods imported into Canada, Embassy Ingredients
          implemented and maintained the following policies and due diligence
          processes in 2025:
        </p>

        <div className="legal-list-item">
          <p className="legal-paragraph">
            <strong>a)</strong> The temporary worker agency engaged by Embassy
            Ingredients has a New, Young, and Vulnerable Worker Policy in place,
            which ensures that new, young, and vulnerable workers fully
            understand their rights and responsibilities by requiring
            supervisors to provide clear orientation and training. For example,
            support is adapted for those who face literacy or language barriers
            by reading materials aloud or offering verbal clarification. Workers
            are also asked questions to check their understanding, and minors
            are required to have a parent or guardian present during the
            registration process, during which the parent/guardian must sign
            both the Parent Guardian Consent form and the employment agreement.
            To date, Embassy Ingredients has not hired any minor from the
            temporary worker agencies it partners with.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="legal-list-item">
          <p className="legal-paragraph">
            <strong>b)</strong> Embassy Ingredients maintains a Policy Manual
            that addresses hours of work by setting a maximum of hours per week
            and by specifying that employees who work beyond the standard
            44-hour workweek prescribed by law will receive the applicable
            overtime rate for all additional hours worked.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="legal-list-item">
          <p className="legal-paragraph">
            <strong>c)</strong> During onboarding, Embassy Ingredients requires
            all new employees to present a government-issued identification
            document to confirm their date of birth and to ensure they meet the
            legal minimum age requirement for employment in their jurisdiction.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="legal-subheading color-primary">
          FORCED LABOUR AND CHILD LABOUR RISKS
        </h3>
        <p className="legal-paragraph">
          Embassy Ingredients has not started the process of identifying the
          risk that child labour and/or forced labour is used in its supply
          chain. Embassy Ingredients is aware that there may be higher risks
          associated with certain regions, goods, and industries, and intends to
          explore options for engaging with the risk identification process in
          subsequent reporting years.
        </p>

        <h3 className="legal-subheading color-primary">REMEDIATION MEASURES</h3>
        <p className="legal-paragraph">
          Embassy Ingredients has not identified any forced labour or child
          labour in its activities. As such, it has not undertaken any
          remediation measures.
        </p>

        <h3 className="legal-subheading color-primary">
          REMEDIATION OF LOSS OF INCOME
        </h3>
        <p className="legal-paragraph">
          Embassy Ingredients has not identified any loss of income to
          vulnerable families resulting from measures taken to eliminate the use
          of forced labour or child labour in its activities and supply chains.
          As such, it has not undertaken any remediation measures.
        </p>

        <h3 className="legal-subheading color-primary">
          TRAINING PROVIDED TO EMPLOYEES
        </h3>
        <p className="legal-paragraph">
          In 2025, Embassy Ingredients did not provide training to its employees
          on forced labour or child labour. Moving forward, it will be assessing
          what related training may be appropriate.
        </p>

        <h3 className="legal-subheading color-primary">
          ASSESSING EFFECTIVENESS
        </h3>
        <p className="legal-paragraph">
          Embassy Ingredients does not currently have specific policies and
          procedures in place to assess its effectiveness in reducing and/or
          eliminating the risk of child labour and/or forced labour in its
          supply chain. However, as outlined above, the policies and procedures
          established by Embassy Ingredients, including the Policy Manual, the
          requirement for age verification with a government-issued piece of
          identification during onboarding, and the New, Young & Vulnerable
          Worker policy implemented by the temporary worker agency, help to
          reduce the risk of child labour and/or forced labour within Embassy
          Ingredients' activities and supply chain.
        </p>

        <h3 className="legal-subheading color-primary">
